    <h2 style="color: forestgreen">Electric cigarettes</h2>
    <p style="background-color: beige">   E-cigarettes are similar to regular cigarettes, except without the burning. They are often sold as an aid to help people quit  smoking or to reduce the amount of time they smoke. However, studies show that vaping has developed into many issues, especially in teens.
</p>
        <h3 style="color: whitesmoke">Who are effected by e-cigarettes the most?</h3>
        
        <p style="background-color: beige">Studies show that teenagers have become the most effected by e cigarettes either directly or indirectly. Teens are effected directly through the use of e- cigarettes and developing various health issues from vaping. They can also be effected indirectly by the promotion of how much better vaping is than actually smoking. Although that may be true in some instances, studies show that teens who vape are most likely going to start smoking.

        <p style ="color:beige">Although vaping may be better than smoking in some instance, it is still dangerous because of the contamination in the e-cig cartridge and the lack of research put into the electronic cigarette.</p>

        <img src="assets/e-cigarette-vapors.jpg" style="width:40%" class="center">
        <p style="background-color: beige"> Most e-cigarette parts that are used in the US are mostly imported from China. The parts however can contain traces of lead.At metal foundries found in China, it is common for companies to place very small amounts of lead in brass and copper products. This allows the metal to be a bit more modeble when shaping for products which also means less cost  production for metals for electrical parts being made. While China does not use lead to purposely put people in danger, it can cause an issue where someone can become contaminated.</p>
        
        <h3 style ="text-align: center"><ins>Endotoxin & Glucan </ins></h3>
        <img src="assets/images.jfif" class="center">
        <p style="background-color: beige">With e-cigarettes containing lead in their cartridges, two more dangerous contaminants can also be found in the e-cigarette vape juice. These contaminants are endotoxin, part of a cell wall from bacteria, and glucan, a part of the makeup of fungi. <br><br>When e-cigarettes are heated up, a liquid containing nicotine is vaporized and inhaled by users. Some liquids contain different flavorings( fruit, mint, etc.) which is believed to be the main cause of the bacteria and fungi forming. Experts also know that some flavorings are linked to heart and blood vessel damages.When the compound is heated up, it breaks down into dangerous chemicals.</p>
