        <b><p style="color: forestgreen">Our mission is to educate and raise awareness in  teens that are vaping (or being influenced) about the various dangers electronic cigarettes can cause .</p></b>
        
        <p style="color: forestgreen"> Our main focus is on teens from 14 to 21 years old in the Metro Atlanta area. We plan to sell different clothing products as well as accessories that support our brand(Snake Vape). We would build a truck that would be a sort of information bus. Inside the truck we would have people come in and learn  about vaping and about the dangers that come from it. They would also be able to buy the various products that we sell spreading the word.</p>
        
        <p style="color:forestgreen">The majority of the money we would get from our costumers would be donated to research centers so scientists could put in more research on electronic cigarettes. If people just wanted to give to the community, they could donate money that we would send to different  hospitals that treat people who have been effected by e-cigarettes..</p>
